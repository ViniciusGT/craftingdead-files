&e&lBuilder Applications
[nl]
We are looking for dedicated members of the community who can set aside time to help with the maintenance of our maps
and also the creation of new and exciting structures to keep the maps up to date.[br]
[nl]
Under the direction of myself you will be tasked with updating existing structures, fixing holes/map bugs that have become 
apparent over the extended usage of the maps and planning new structures that will then be built.
We will be looking for a high level of building finesse and exceptional attention to detail in the build submissions we receive in these applications, 
Please only apply if you believe you have what it takes.
[nl]
You can apply via this google form: https://forms.gle/bS3FRHsTPojCUxZq8
If you have any questions please direct them to myself in PMs and I will happily answer any queries.

(Dead Island, Atlanta, Somerset, Charland & Riverside) within the next 24 hours! [br]

Downloads, Cloud & Website are going to be hosted by the revenue generated from the community servers, [br]
We are going to be changing the ranks to make them less pay to win. [br]

We are going to do our best to move most of the ranks over to these servers however [br]
since they are not the official servers there is no way of guaranteeing anyone their rank. [br]
